# IssueTracker_Client_Game

# ‚òòÔ∏è Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering course. The objective was to create an innovative Issue Management System that allows users to manage project tasks in an engaging and interactive manner. By incorporating a tank game interface, users can browse projects and issues as if navigating through a game world, rather than a traditional webpage. The system supports functionalities such as creating issues, assigning tasks, setting priorities, and tracking the progress of issues. Additionally, it includes an admin page for managing projects with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities. This unique approach aims to make project management more enjoyable and visually appealing.
